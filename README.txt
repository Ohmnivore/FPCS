Automates: JRT.exe, ClamWin scanner, UltraDefrag, and cleanmgr.exe

This is my effort at making an automated PC decrapifier process.
This is the version that uses open-source tools (except for JRT.exe,
it's freeware). I also have another version I can't distribute because
I can't bundle proprietary software (obviously), but
details are in the link below.
