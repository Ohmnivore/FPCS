Automates: JRT.exe, ClamWin scanner, UltraDefrag, and cleanmgr.exe

This is my effort at making an automated PC decrapifier process.
This is the version that uses open-source tools (except for JRT.exe,
it's freeware). I also have another version I can't distribute because
I can't bundle proprietary software (obviously), but
details are in the link below.

How to use:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run Clean.bat
Optional paramater: Clean.bat [drive letter, default is c]
Ex: Clean.bat d

Optional flag: --delete will allow ClamWin to delete the threats
it finds, instead of merely logging them in WinClampLog.txt
Ex: Cleam.bat c --delete

Run Clean.bat/help, Clean.bat -h, or Clean.bat --help for, errrh, help
